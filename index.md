## Solidarity over charity.

**Utah Valley Mutual Aid** is a [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)) network for the whole Utah Valley. We seek to empower each other individually and communally through direct action and mutual aid. This might be groceries, medical supplies, prescriptions or other necessities that are hard to acquire in times of panic. We seek to serve and strengthen those on the margins and build resiliency in neighborhoods across the region.

Please join us today.
